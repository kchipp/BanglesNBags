                <p>"Opening for business almost ten years ago, Bangles & Bags has a unique company history that paved the way
                    to the successful local community merchant it is today.
                    <br> It started in 2004 when Susan King Steiner set her mind on becoming her own boss and opening a business.
                    With this objective created, the first Bangles & Bags was opened. She did so in a small retail space
                    attached to a custard and sandwich shop in downtown Delafield. Soon this location would not suffice and
                    thus she moved the business one block away to Main Street. This would become the permanent Delafield
                    location.
                    <br>
                    <br> By the beginning of 2009, Susan took what she had learned from opening the first store and proceeded
                    to open the second Bangles & Bags location in downtown Waukesha. Soon after, the powerful relationship
                    between Susan and 'soon to be' business partner and friend, Jeanette Dvorak, was started. It all began
                    when Jeanette walked into the Delafield location after noticing a 'help wanted' sign on the front door.
                    Even though Jeanette had been a customer for years, that was the first time the two of them had met.
                    Jeanette was hired and within six months the two ladies were about to embark on a very aggressive growth
                    pattern for Bangles & Bags.
                    <br>
                    <br> Holding a degree in Retail Merchandising, Jeanette had a background in marketing, promotions, and
                    most of all fashion. That coupled with Susan's widespread experience, contacts and business savvy flair,
                    the partnership was destined to be successful and they both knew it. Soon the dynamic duo opened the
                    third location in the downtown Milwaukee's Historic Third Ward. Over the next three years, Bangles &
                    Bags opened four more locations in each of the downtown locations of Cedarburg, Wauwatosa, Madison, and
                    Oconomowoc. Additionally, Bangles & Bags was making themselves known to the public through the creation
                    of their website, Facebook page, and various other medium advertisements. </p>

                <p>The business model is simple and a is stated very clearly in their company tag line "Feel Fabulous
                    for Less".  Bangles & Bags focuses on being present in local downtown communities catering to women of all ages as well as
                    men looking to purchase quality accessory items at an affordable price. The merchandise is always up
                    to date as Susan and Jeanette go on buying trips approximately every six to eight weeks to ensure their
                    customers are offered the latest trends and styles. In addition to jewelry and handbags, the store carries
                    other accessory items such as wallets, sunglasses, hair accessories, scarves, and hats.
                    Bangles & Bags looks forward to continuing to serve the local community customers for a long, long
                    time!"
